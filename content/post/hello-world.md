It's been some time since I wanted to just write something! You know what, “some time” isn’t even close. It's been years.

Given that I am a master procrastinator, I would like this post to be the perfect post in case I never come around to write more.

Statistically speaking, that would be one which could also serve as the last post. And therefore, adiós! It was great journey, this wonderful hobby, but I am onto something better now, far less challenging than writing of course!

SM.
